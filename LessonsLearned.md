# Lessons Learned  
Lessons learned while working on the course:  
- new languages/technologies:
  - TypeScript: "a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript"
    - Can use self-closing tags like ```<Messsage />``` if we want an empty element instead of ```<Message></Message>```
  - React: "a JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive UI" or "a front-end framework that has gradually become the go-to framework for modern web dev within the JS community"
    - It lets us build a single-page application (SPA); that is, it loads a single HTML document on the first request, and then updates any specific portion, content, or body that needs it using JavaScript. This is known as client-side routing because the client doesn't have to reload the full webpage to get a new page each time a user makes a new request; instead, React intercepts the request and only fetches and changes the sections that need changing without having to trigger a full page reload. React relies on a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). The virtual DOM is immediately reloaded to reflect any changes, and react-dom then compares it to the actual DOM to find the least expensive way to patch the changes.
    - We do this through small, efficient "components" which React uses to efficiently create and update the DOM. Components help us write reusable, modular, and better-organized code. They're a bit like building blocks, and can be thought of as a tree, with the root being the whole app (App), and each child being smaller parts that build upon each other.
    - React components are often written in TypeScript, and given the file extension .jsx
      - They are often written as functions, but can also be written as classes.
      - They are used like regular JSX (which looks like regular HTML), with opening and closing tags
- Vite: a frontend dev tool that comes with a dev server and is used for modern web applications
  - It has hot module replacement (HMR) which adds, updates, or removes modules while an application runs without reloading the entire page, making the dev workflow faster.
- React project structure:
  - node_modules: this folder contains all 3rd party libraries, including React
  - public: this folder contains public assets, like images, media files, etc.
  - src: this folder is the source for our application
    - contains App.tsx, which contains the App component
    - contains index.html
      - has a <div> element with the id "root", which is the container for our application
      - has a <script> element with the source "/src/main.tsx" which is the entry point to our application
    - contains package.json, which has info about the project (like the name, version, and dependencies)
      - dependencies are libraries the app itself depends on
      - devDependencies are used only for development, and are not shipped with the app
    - contains tsconfig.json, which has settings that tell the compiler how to compile our file to javascript
